Android App for Diwan's audio dramas.
- Allows for the user to check news, explore different audio dramas.
- He can then choose an episode and listen to it.

How it works :
- Data retrieved from an XML file on the admin website.
- The application parses it to retrieve data.
- Then, the UI (menus, categories) are dynamically created from these data.
